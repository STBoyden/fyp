# Final year project

## Building

For both \*NIX-based systems and Windows, `go` version 1.22+, and the `just` command are
required. `just` can be found, and installed from [here](https://github.com/casey/just/).

To build, use `just`:

```bash
just build          # builds both the server and the game
just run            # runs the server and a single game instance
```
