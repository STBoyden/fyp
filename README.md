# University final year project

The task for my final year project is a multiplayer networked game. Progress (b)logs can be found [here](https://blog.stboyden.com).

I have decided to implement the project using Rust or Go -- though the specifics of implementation are not yet solid and the framework or engine I will use to create the game.

I am leaning towards Go.

## Rust

A list for Rust is found on https://arewegameyet.rs. The options are:

- Bevy - probably the most mature option.
- Ambient - never heard of it, but is specifically targeted towards multiplayer networked games, but impressions from the site seem to lean towards it being batteries included, and therefore may effect the amount of "points" rewarded for the actual networking implementation.
- Amethyst - data driven, may be useful for a networked game.

## Go

There are a few good options listed on this website https://gamefromscratch.com/game-development-in-the-go-programming-language.
